# EarlyStoping:
# - monitor: quantity to be monitored. has value 'loss', 'val_loss'
# - patience: number of epochs with no improvement after which training
#             will be stopped. default 10.
# - mode: one of {auto, min, max}.
#         In `min` mode, training will stop when the quantity
#         monitored has stopped decreasing;
#         in `max` mode it will stop when the quantity
#         monitored has stopped increasing;
#         in `auto` mode, the direction is automatically inferred
#         from the name of the monitored quantity.
# - baseline: Baseline value for the monitored quantity to reach.
#            Training will stop if the model doesn't show improvement
#            over the baseline.
# Epochs: Integer. Number of epochs to train the model.
# BatchSize: Integer. Training batch size
# TestBatchSize: Integer. Test batch size
# TestSetNum: Integer. Limit test set number.
